# The Hermes Microkernel
A Raspberry Pi 3+ Microkernel Operating System.

## Getting Started
To get started, ensure you've installed the necessary prerequisite software and set up your
toolchain. You can see the project wiki for more information about this.

Once you've done that, you can get a copy of the system built and running in QEMU by running
the following in the project root directory:
```bash
$ ./scripts/run.sh
```
